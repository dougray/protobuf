# Websocket to bi-directional gRPC stream proxy

This package implements a Websocket to gRPC streaming proxy.
It supports both client side streaming and bi-directional streams.

## Using the proxy
The proxy exposes the `WrapServer` method, which creates
a `http.Handler`. It could be used like so:

```go
gs := grpc.NewServer()
... // Perform registration to gs
handler := wsproxy.WrapServer(gs)
http.ListenAndServe("localhost:8080", handler)
```

Most of the time you'll want to set up TLS as well.
[See the test setup](../test/server/main.go) for an example of this.

## Connecting to the proxy
A Websocket client wishing to perform gRPC streaming
should send a websocket upgrade request to the same URL
as would have been used for the gRPC streaming request.
This will usually look something like this:

```
https://host/PackageName.ServiceName/MethodName
```

The websocket upgrade request will be intercepted and a gRPC
client stream will be opened to the underlying gRPC server.

## The "protocol"
After the connection has been established, the following message format is expected:

1. Each incoming message is a proto encoded binary blob.
This message is passed directly to the gRPC stream.
A message consisting of the ASCII string "clos" indicates a wish
to close the stream.
1. Replies are sent as encoded proto binary blobs.
1. Errors are sent with a websocket Close control message.
gRPC error codes are mapped by adding 4000 to the error code.
